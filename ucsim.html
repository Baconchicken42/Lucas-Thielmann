    <p> During college, I did Co-op/part-time work at <a href="ucsim.uc.edu">The University of Cincinnati's Center for 
        Simulations and Virtual Environments Research</a>. 
        <br><br>
        At UCSIM, I worked on mostly AR/VR projects in the Unity game engine. The purposes of these projects varied, including 
        immersive storytelling, and research projects, and medical simulations. 
        <br><br>
        UCSIM has a small development team, which meant I had the opportunity to work with many different elements of the 
        development pipeline. During my time there I had been responsible for gameplay programming, level design, environment 
        design, event sequencing, performance optimization, and more.
