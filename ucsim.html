    <p> During college, I did Co-op/part-time work at <a href="ucsim.uc.edu">The University of Cincinnati's Center for 
        Simulations and Virtual Environments Research</a>. 
        <br><br>
        At UCSIM, I worked on mostly AR/VR projects in the Unity game engine. The purposes of these projects varied, including 
        immersive storytelling, and research projects, and medical simulations. 
        <br><br>
        UCSIM has a small development team, which meant I had the opportunity to work with many different elements of the 
        development pipeline. During my time there I had been responsible for gameplay programming, level design, environment 
        design, event sequencing, performance optimization, and more.

        <h2>Hope After Hate</h2>
        <h3>Immersive VR Storytelling</h3>
        <p>Hope After Hate is a VR narrative experience which tells the story of holocaust survivor Moniek Lipszyc. 
            Players explore various locations from Moniek's story, and can view what those locations look like in the 
            present by interacting with 360Â° video globes placed around the scenes. 
            <br><br>
            My work on this project consisted mainly of sequencing dialogue, animation, and events, as well as quality 
            assurance and fixing bugs. Later on I was also tasked with refining the design of one of the levels to be more 
            condensed, as well as implementing more environmental detail.
