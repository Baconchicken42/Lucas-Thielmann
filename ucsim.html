    <p> During college, I did Co-op/part-time work at <a href="ucsim.uc.edu">The University of Cincinnati's Center for 
        Simulations and Virtual Environments Research</a>. 
        <br><br>
        At UCSIM, I worked on mostly AR/VR projects in the Unity game engine. The purposes of these projects varied, including 
        immersive storytelling, and research projects, and medical simulations. 
        <br><br>
        UCSIM has a small development team, which meant I had the opportunity to work with many different elements of the 
        development pipeline. During my time there I had been responsible for gameplay programming, level design, environment 
        design, event sequencing, performance optimization, and more.

        <h2>Hope After Hate</h2>
        <h3>Immersive VR Storytelling</h3>
        <p>Hope After Hate is a VR narrative experience which tells the story of holocaust survivor Moniek Lipszyc. 
            Players explore various locations from Moniek's story, and can view what those locations look like in the 
            present by interacting with 360Â° video globes placed around the scenes. 
            <br><br>
            My work on this project consisted mainly of sequencing dialogue, animation, and events, as well as quality 
            assurance and fixing bugs. Later on I was also tasked with refining the design of one of the levels to be more 
            condensed, as well as implementing more environmental detail.

        <h2>CAP Research Framework</h2>
        <h3>Experiment Development Tools</h3>
        <p>This was not a standalone playable experience but rather a set of tools we developed for the Cognition Action 
            Perception Center at UC to make it easier for researchers to develop multiplayer VR experiments. These experiments 
            involved situations where test subjects would have to cooperate on a task that they had asynchronous information 
            about (for example, objects being visible for one person and not another).
            <br><br>
            The toolset included several "behaviors" which could be applied to objects in the unity editor. I was responsible 
            for developing several of these, including a behavior where objects would be differently colored for different 
            participants, one where different amounts of lens distortion could be applied, and one where controller haptics 
            could be applied differently.

            <p> I can't share much about this project other than that my responsibilities included level/environment design,
                and programming of key VR gameplay mechanics.

        <h2>Medicaid Care Experience Simulation</h2>
        <h3>Patient Care Simulation</h3>
        <p>MCARES is a set of three simulations designed to help healthcare providers empathize with patients. Each 
            simulation followed a character in need of specialized care and explored the difficulties they had in 
            getting it.
            <br><br>
            My work on this project consisted mainly of sequencing animations, audio, and interactions, as well as bug 
            fixing.
            <br><br>
            The project was intended for a more general audience, so was developed for WebGL with mouse-based point-and-click 
            controls.
