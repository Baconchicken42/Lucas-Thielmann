    <p> I took over development on this project during my Co-op at the German Aerospace Center in Braunschweig, Germany as the sole developer. 
        The Remote AFISO project was a prototype for an extension of the existing "Remote Tower" concept. This is a concept 
        where the air traffic service at an airport can be supported or managed from a location other than the control tower. 
        The goal of this concept is to be able to support airports during busy times with remote air traffic controllers, and 
        it has already been successfully implemented at many airports around the world.
        <br><br>
        Normally, the Remote Tower requires a 360 degree array of cameras, plus a great deal of monitors and equipment in 
        the Remote Tower Center itself. The goal of this project was to develop a prototype of a low-cost VR version for use 
        by Aerodrome Flight Information Service Officers (AFISOs) at smaller airports. An AFISO differs from an ATC in that they 
        do not provide takeoff clearance, but weather and hazard information, so the Remote AFISO Workplace would only need to 
        keep track of incoming/outgoing flights, and have a view of the airport. My colleague performed a 
        <a href="PDFs/DLR/Remote VR Tower.pdf" style="color:blue">research study</a> 
        using the finished prototype to determine the viability of such a system.

        <h2>Camera Array</h2>
        <p> When I took over the project, some development had already been done. The setup included two 180 panoramic cameras 
             to provide the 360 degree view, as well as a Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera on top.
            <br><br>
            In VR, the panoramas were stitched together into the full 360 degrees, and the PTZ camera was represented by an 
            overlay which could be toggled on and off. The PTZ could be controlled with a single button press, which would point 
            it in the direction the user was looking. Initially the PTZ was only controllable through the keyboard.
